**Keylogger and Processed Log**

This project includes a simple keylogger written in Python, designed for educational purposes only. The keylogger logs keyboard input and saves it to a file named `keylog.log`. Additionally, a function is provided to process the keylog file, join the strings to form words, and replace special key codes with appropriate characters, such as replacing `key.space` with spaces.

**Usage**

1. **Running the Keylogger:**
   - Ensure you have Python and the `pynput` library installed (`pip install pynput`).
   - Execute the `keylogger.py` script. The keylogger will start capturing keyboard input and save it to `keylog.log` in the user's desktop directory.
   - To stop the keylogger, press the 'Esc' key.

2. **Processing the Keylog:**
   - After stopping the keylogger, the `process_keylog(log_file)` function can be used to read the `keylog.log` file, process the keylog, and return the processed sentence.
   - Special key codes like `Key.space` will be replaced with spaces.
   - Additional replacements for other special keys can be added if required (e.g., `Key.enter` for newlines).

**Note**
- Use this code responsibly and only on your own devices or with explicit permission from the device owner.
- Keyloggers can be misused to invade privacy and violate laws and regulations.
- The primary purpose of this code is for educational purposes and understanding the concepts involved in keylogging.
- Misuse of keyloggers without consent on other people's devices is illegal and unethical.

**Disclaimer**
The author of this code take no responsibility for any misuse or harm caused by the use of this keylogger. This code is provided for educational purposes only, and any use of it for unauthorized or malicious purposes is entirely the responsibility of the user.
